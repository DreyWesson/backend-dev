Folder Descriptions:
/config: Central place for configuration settings like environment variables, database configurations, and other environment-specific settings.

/controllers: Holds functions for handling HTTP requests and interacting with the database or services. They handle business logic and pass data between routes and models.

/models: Database models or schemas, used to define and interact with the database (e.g., using Mongoose or Sequelize).

/routes: Contains the routing logic, which connects HTTP requests to the appropriate controller functions. Organize by resource, like userRoutes.js.

/middlewares: Custom middlewares for the application, like authentication, logging, or request validation.

/services: Holds reusable logic or classes, such as external API integrations, logging, caching, or email services.

/utils: Utility functions, such as encryption, validation, or error handling, that are not directly related to business logic but are reusable across the application.

/logs: Centralized logging directory where log files can be written by the logger (e.g., Winston, Morgan).

/public: Static assets like images, stylesheets, and client-side JavaScript for the frontend (e.g., if using Express to serve a frontend).

/views: If you are using a templating engine like EJS, Pug, or Handlebars for server-side rendered HTML, these files would go here.

/tests: Unit and integration tests for the application’s modules.

/scripts: Utility scripts for seeding databases, running scheduled jobs, or automating deployment tasks.

/docker: Docker-related files like Dockerfile or docker-compose configuration to containerize the application.

.env: Holds environment-specific variables like API keys, database URIs, etc. This file should be included in .gitignore for security reasons.

server.js: The entry point to your Node.js application that sets up Express and starts the server.
