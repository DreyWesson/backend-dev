Building a simple messaging service.
Designing a scalable logging service for a distributed system.
Building a file upload and processing service.
Behavioral Questions
In addition to technical questions, interviewers may ask behavioral questions to understand your experience and problem-solving approach, such as:

Describe a challenging bug you encountered in a Node.js application and how you resolved it.
Talk about a time when you improved the performance of a Node.js service.
How do you stay updated with the latest trends and technologies in the Node.js ecosystem?
Tips for Preparation
Practice Coding: Use platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, or Exercism to practice JavaScript and Node.js coding problems.
Understand Node.js Internals: Explore the Node.js documentation to deepen your understanding of core modules, events, and performance optimization.
Hands-on Projects: Build small projects, such as RESTful APIs, microservices, or chat applications, to showcase your skills.
Preparing for these topics and types of questions will help you build confidence for backend Node.js interviews.
